SteamGameRatings is a web application that sorts your steam game library based on the Steam user reviews. The Steam client only lets you sort your games based on metacritic scores which is unavailable for many games. Thus, SteamGameRatings allows you to sort your games in a more uniformed manner through user reviews.
