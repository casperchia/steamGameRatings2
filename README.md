# steamGameRatings2 (Django version)

SteamGameRatings is a web application that sorts your steam game library based on Steam's user reviews. The Steam client only lets you sort your games based on metacritic scores which is unavailable for many games. Thus, SteamGameRatings allows you to sort all your games in a more uniformed manner through user reviews.
